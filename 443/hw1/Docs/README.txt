Program takes the inputs from a file named configure.txt

Format is as follows:

# of traders
name of the trader
nickname of the trader
path for his gif
.
.
.
# of conmen
name of the conman
path for his gif
.
.
.

A sample configure.txt is also added here.

Besides the default implementation, I also made Common class a singleton.

Screen size is 800x800.
